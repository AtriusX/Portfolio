# Portfolio Design Document

For the redesign of my personal portfolio, more time needs to be spent determining the details of what the scope and constraints of the design will be, as well as the primary goal that the project is meant to accomplish.

## Function

The primary function of the site should be to showcase my work, as well as my experience and skills. 

The purpose of the site currently will *not* be to function as a personal blog or in any similar capacity. This would require a level of overhead on either providing a dynamic back end, or extra load on the build system. The former being financially unconsiderable, and the latter being generally undesirable. Existing social platforms can otherwise suffice for this.

Overall, this should otherwise be treated as an extension of your resume, though more directed at showcasing my personal work rather than professional work. Use this as a way to streamline your image and provide more in-depth information that might be useful for potential clients or employers. 

With that in mind, you should ensure a sibling package of data that you would otherwise not list publicly. This should include your formal resume, as well as a reference sheet and any other information that might be relevant to potential recruiters. In this case, it may be wise to have an application flag which can be used to determine current user state. Either for if I'm looking for work or just to showcase my code. 

## Color scheme

The color scheme of the portfolio should be fairly light, but reflect my personal and brand identity in some way. Care should also be considered in the color choice, as the scheme must be compatibile with light and dark themes.

A couple initial angles could be to somehow incorporate my previous brand color **#06F** and build around that. However, a more immediately relevant approach might be to use various shades of light purple and orange. This would be more in line with the itdentity of the languages I develop in, java and kotlin. 

A compromise approach may be to use alternative color sets for both dark and light themes. This could allow me to specify a light theme with a relevant identity, while also allowing me to preserve previous colors in the dark theme.

## Style

The overall portfolio style should focus on simplicity, however it should also attempt to be as lively as possible by taking advantage of animations when applicable. Mobile friendliness may require that some or all of these animations are muted for non-desktop devices, or at least for phones.
